# DictationDaddy 

Welcome to DictationDaddy, a project born out of frustration with current dictation tools.      
As a developer, I often find it painful to type everytime as it causes pain in shoulder.       
so, I often use dictation tools to write.

# Why Dictation Daddy is better than traditional Dictation tools.

Current dictation tools sucks :- 
1. Their transcriptions is not upto the mark. 
2. They are dumb and don't understand the user intent very well. 
3. Navigation to fix the errors in the transcription is painful. 
4. Basic transcriptions like converting date to MM-DD-YY format will require manual intervention.  
5. You can't write code using them.
6. You can't give commands like delete the first paragraph.

All the above things are possible in Dictation Daddy.
1. You can issue command and edit with voice. https://youtu.be/QWqg4wqTm2E?si=EOblVhwRFBwE5DCl
2. Smart enough to insert the links https://youtu.be/Pn1M8Eee-tQ?si=CzLpzXLdhUtfT0xp
3. Full demo explaining the product https://youtu.be/Cu9fyC-mObA?si=RFhWeRPMXFfxe7fB

# Vision
1. Aim is to build an personal assistant that can accomplish task from users voice.
2. It should be smart enough to have past memory.
3. It should be smart enough to predict user intents.
