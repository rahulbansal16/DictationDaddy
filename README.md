# DictationDaddy 

Welcome to DictationDaddy, a project born out of frustration with current dictation tools.      
As a developer, I often find it painful to type everytime as it causes pain in shoulder.       
so, I often use dictation tools to write.

But, the current dictation tools sucks :- 
1. Their transcriptions is not upto the mark. 
2. They are dumb and don't understand the user intent very well. 
3. Navigation to fix the errors in the transcription is painful. 
4. Basic transcriptions like converting date to MM-DD-YY format will require manual intervention.  
5. You can't write code using them.
6. You can't give commands like delete the first paragraph.


# Vision
1. Aim is to build an personal assistant that can accomplish task from users voice.
2. It should be smart enough to have past memory.
3. It should be smart enough to predict user intents.

Check out this demo to understand it.
